# TODOS

## Open

### Wire PaywallScreen into navigation
`src/screens/PaywallScreen.tsx` exists and is polished (TouchableOpacity, a11y labels, CTA guard) but is not registered in `RootNavigator.tsx`. Needs: register the screen in the auth stack, decide trigger condition (free-trial expiry? specific SKU?), wire `onSubscribe`/`onRestore`/`onClose` callbacks to a subscription hook.
